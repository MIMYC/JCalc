# JCalc
A Java library for math lovers!

Hi! JCalc is a Java library that adds a lot of mathematical functions in Java. On combining JCalc with java.Math, it makes easy for Java to be used for mathematical computing.

How to use:

1. Extract the JCalc.zip file in your project folder.
2. add "import JCalc.*;" on top of the class in which you want to use the functions provided by JCalc.
3. You can now access all of JCalc's functions by using the syntax "jcalc.();"
